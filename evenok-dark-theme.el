;;; Commentary:

;; base16-evenok-dark-theme is a color theme for Emacs that aims to
;; perceptively evenly distribute its colors while maximizing their
;; chroma (colorfulness).

;; Screenshots are available at:
;; - Emacs Lisp: <https://envs.sh/hJc.png>
;; - TypeScript: <https://envs.sh/hJj.png>

;; base16-evenok-dark-theme is built with base16. Thus, it only uses
;; 16 colors; 8 greyscale and 8 actual colors.

;; TODO: fix colors restricting to rgb. currently experimenting with:
;; oklch(72% 0.13 175)

;; The 8 colors have been picked using the OKLCH color space (using
;; the color picker website <https://oklch.com>), which makes sure
;; that they are perceived with equal lightness and that they are
;; evenly distributed in the perceived spectrum (with 45째 inbetween).
;; The primary goal of the color selection has been the maximization
;; of chroma (i.e. colorfulness) (0.165) and secondly of lightness
;; (71.1%). The two gaps, that appear on the hue-axis with the
;; mentioned chroma and lightness values, have been avoided with an
;; appropriate offset, namely 10째.

;;; Code:

(require 'base16-theme)

(defvar base16-evenok-dark-theme-colors
  (list

    ;; greyscale.
    :base00 "#000000"
    :base01 "#333333"
    :base02 "#444444"
    :base03 "#888888"
    :base04 "#bbbbbb"
    :base05 "#dddddd"
    :base06 "#ffffff"
    :base07 "#ffffff"

    ;; colors. based on oklch(73.6% 0.135 358+n*45째), i.e.
    ;; lightness  L=73.6%
    ;; chroma     C=0.135
    ;; hue offset H=358째

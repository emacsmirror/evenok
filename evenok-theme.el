;;; Commentary:

;; evenok-theme is a color theme for Emacs that aims to perceptively
;; evenly distribute its colors while primarily maximizing their
;; chroma (colorfulness) and secondly their lightness.

;; Screenshots are available at:
;; - Emacs Lisp: <https://envs.sh/hJc.png>
;; - TypeScript: <https://envs.sh/hJj.png>

;; evenok-theme is built with base16. Thus, it only uses 16 colors; 8
;; greyscale and 8 actual colors.

;; The greyscale is currently simply copied from base16-pop-theme. It
;; may be subject of changes.

;; The 8 colors have been picked using the OKLCH color space (using
;; the color picker website <https://oklch.com>), which makes sure
;; that they are perceived with equal lightness and that they are
;; evenly distributed in the perceived spectrum (with 45째 inbetween).
;; The primary goal of the color selection has been the maximization
;; of chroma (i.e. colorfulness) (0.165) and secondly of lightness
;; (71.1%). The two gaps, that appear on the hue-axis with the
;; mentioned chroma and lightness values, have been avoided with an
;; appropriate offset, namely 10째.

;; In addition to the colors provided by base16, this theme also
;; provides some basic face attributes for font-lock.

;;; Code:

(require 'base16-theme)

(defvar evenok-theme-colors
  (list

    ;; greyscale. copied from base16-pop-theme-colors.
    :base00 "#000000"
    :base01 "#202020"
    :base02 "#303030"
    :base03 "#505050"
    :base04 "#b0b0b0"
    :base05 "#d0d0d0"
    :base06 "#e0e0e0"
    :base07 "#ffffff"

    ;; colors. based on oklch with l=71.1% and c=0.165. gap at blue
    ;; and cyan hues. offset 10째 for red and 190째 for cyan.
